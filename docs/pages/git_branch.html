<h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">Git Branching Strategies for DevOps Engineers</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Main Branch (main/master): The production-ready branch. All code here should be stable and tested.</p>
<p>2. Feature Branches: Branch off from the main branch to work on new features. Keep them short-lived and merge back to main once complete and reviewed.</p>
<p>3. Release Branches: Create these when you're preparing a new release. They allow for final bug fixes and polishing before merging into the main branch.</p>
<p>4. Hotfix Branches: For urgent fixes on the production code. These branches are crucial for quick and isolated bug fixes.</p>
<p>5. Development Branch (develop): An optional branch that serves as an integration branch for features. This is where ongoing development happens before merging into the main branch.</p>
<p>6. Epic Branches: For larger projects, an epic branch can group related feature branches. It helps in managing complex development work.</p>
