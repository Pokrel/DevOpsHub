    <h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">What is Docker?</span></h2>
    <p>Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. It allows you to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development and deployment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">Key Concepts</span></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Containers&nbsp;<br>- Lightweight, standalone executable packages<br>- Include everything needed to run an application<br>- Ensure consistency across different environments</p>
    <p>2. Images&nbsp;<br>- Read-only templates used to create containers<br>- Built from layers, each representing an instruction in the Dockerfile<br>- Can be shared via Docker Hub or private registries</p>
    <p>3. Dockerfile&nbsp;<br>- Text file containing instructions to build a Docker image<br>- Defines the environment inside the container<br>- Automates the image creation process</p>
    <p>4. Docker Compose&nbsp;<br>- Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications<br>- Uses YAML files to configure application services<br>- Simplifies complex setups with a single command</p>
    <p>5. Docker Swarm&nbsp;<br>- Native clustering and scheduling tool for Docker<br>- Turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual host<br>- Enables easy scaling and management of containerized applications</p>
    <h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">Benefits of Docker</span></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>• Consistency: "It works on my machine" becomes a thing of the past<br>• Isolation: Applications and their dependencies are separated from the host system<br>• Efficiency: Lightweight containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead<br>• Portability: Containers can run anywhere Docker is installed<br>• Scalability: Easy to scale applications horizontally by spinning up new containers</p>
    <h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">Best Practices</span></h2>
    <p>1. Keep images small and focused<br>2. Use multi-stage builds to optimize Dockerfiles<br>3. Leverage Docker Compose for local development<br>4. Implement proper logging and monitoring<br>5. Regularly update base images and dependencies<br>6. Use volume mounts for persistent data<br>7. Implement proper security measures (e.g., least privilege principle)</p>
    <h2><span style="color:#15ff00;">Getting Started</span></h2>
    <p>1. Install Docker on your machine<br>2. Familiarize yourself with basic commands (docker run, build, pull, push)<br>3. Create your first Dockerfile and build an image<br>4. Experiment with Docker Compose for multi-container setups<br>5. Explore Docker Hub for pre-built images and inspiration</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Docker has become an essential skill for developers and operations teams alike. Its ability to streamline development workflows, improve deployment consistency, and enhance scalability makes it a crucial tool in modern software development.</p>
