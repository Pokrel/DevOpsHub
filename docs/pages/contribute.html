    <h2>Brief Intro</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my little slice of cyberspace! G-yan isn't my official name, but some friends call me that—long story short, it stuck. I'm a DevOps engineer with an insatiable passion for cutting-edge technologies. I'm in the process of creating this website where I'll study, research, and document all things tech, and then host it on GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>This site is designed to be a treasure trove of knowledge for System Administrators, DevOps aficionados, and SRE professionals. If you’ve accidentally landed here, sit tight. You're in for a ride filled with tech insights, a dash of humor, and perhaps a few surprises. Buckle up and enjoy! Lol!</p>
