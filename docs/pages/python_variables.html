    <h2>Python Variables</h2>
    <h2>Why python?</h2>
    <p>As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
    <pre>>> print("Hello, World!")<br>Hello, World!</pre>
    <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>
    <pre>C:\Users\Your Name&gt;python myfile.py</pre>
    <h2>Python Indentation</h2>
    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
    <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
